# Hexagonal Architecture Tutorial with Golang

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is a step-by-step tutorial for implementing **Hexagonal Architecture** using **Golang**.

The goal of this project is to help developers—especially those new to Go—understand how to structure clean, maintainable applications using the Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) pattern.

## 🧠 How This Works

Each use case or topic will be explored in a **separate Git branch**.  
You can switch between branches to learn incrementally. Every change is committed step by step and file by file, making it easier to follow the development flow and reasoning behind each implementation.

The `main` branch acts as the base project. From there, you can jump into other branches to explore specific features or implementations.

## 📚 Available Learning Branches
Below are some learning branches currently available.  
> ⚠️ **Note:** New branches will continue to be added as we cover more real-world use cases.

- [`learn/create-new-endpoint`](https://https://github.com/rizky1987/rzq-hexagonal/tree/learn/create-new-endpoint)  
  Learn how to create a new API endpoint using the Hexagonal Architecture pattern.

- [`learn/add-framework-fiber`](https://github.com/rizky1987/rzq-hexagonal/tree/learn/add-framework-fiber)  
  Learn how to integrate **two Go web frameworks** (e.g., Echo and Fiber) in one project while keeping the architecture clean and decoupled.
